When you create an SSH connection, it is automatically set to the current channel (LAN) However, you can create more than 1 connection. To do this, write the command for creating a connection again. As you will notice, the new connection replaced the previous one, but it did not complete, but remained open. In order to find out all the existing connections, write `~clist`. You will be presented with ip connections and their id. Now you can write` ~connect id-connection` to connect to the connection you need. IMPORTANT! You can connect connections to any channels that the bot has access to. For there can be only one current connection for each channel. To disconnect from the current connection, write `~disconnect`. If you need to terminate the connection, write` ~end connection id` or `~end` for the current connection enia. ",
